# The Deadly 'White Sea' — Russia's Poisoned Mother River

The Volga, Europe's longest river and known as "Russia's Mother River," faces a severe environmental crisis as the price of massive Soviet-era development.

Eight giant dams, toxic waste from chemical weapons factories, and water pollution that remains unresolved to this day.
What happened to the "Mother River" that sustains the lives of 60 million people?
Together with the reality of the deadly toxic pond "Beloye Morye" (White Sea) lying in Volgograd, we examine the question of development versus environmental preservation.

🔍 What you'll learn in this video:
・ The importance of the Volga River — 40% of Russia's population lives in its basin
・ Massive Soviet-era development and its consequences — dam construction, forced labor, submerged villages
・ The reality of pollution — 40% of wastewater concentrated here, only 10% treated
・ "Beloye Morye" — the chemical weapons factory dump site
・ The current state of environmental restoration efforts that struggle to make progress

🔔 This video is recommended for:
・ Those interested in environmental issues
・ Those who want to learn about the impact of Soviet-era authoritarian development
・ Those who want to think about the balance between development and environmental preservation
