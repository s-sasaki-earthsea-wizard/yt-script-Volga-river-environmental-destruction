1
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:04,605
Comrades!

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:10,705
The great Soviet Union has conquered the Volga, the longest river in all of Europe!

3
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:14,069
Huge dams power our great leap forward!

4
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:19,790
The grand canals connecting five seas are symbols of the people's unity!

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,506
Bring the Mother River's gift to all!

6
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:25,933
This is the true victory of Socialism!

7
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:28,913
The great Soviet Union is no more.

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,031
But its legacy still remains today.

9
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:34,963
Check that legacy on Google Maps.

10
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:39,479
Volgograd. Site of the bloodiest battle in WWII.

11
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:47,063
Defended by brave citizens, it's now a thriving metropolis home to a million people.

12
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:50,018
Wait... what's this?

13
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:53,622
There's a strange white structure along the riverbank.

14
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,714
It's apparently called the "Beloye Morye."

15
00:00:57,366 --> 00:01:00,366
In Russian, that means "The White Sea."

16
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:01,990
The White Sea?!

17
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:04,262
White doesn't suit Russia!

18
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:07,317
Russia must be dyed a beautiful red!

19
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:11,281
This "White Sea" is actually a highly toxic pool.

20
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:15,437
When chemical weapons factories were built in the Soviet era,

21
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:20,074
their waste products were dumped right here.

22
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:22,646
Mercury, phenol, benzopyrene

23
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:29,805
Massive amounts of these toxins are stored in a reservoir right next to the Volga River.

24
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:32,833
And it's right near residential areas.

25
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:39,438
Since the 70s, they've dumped lime to neutralize the waste, which is why it turned white.

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,536
The Volga, Russia's "Mother River," is now facing a severe environmental crisis.

27
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:54,886
Today, let's explore development and conservation through the environmental issues of the Volga.

28
00:01:54,986 --> 00:02:04,442
The Volga River is 3,530 km long, with a basin area of 1.36 million square kilometers.

29
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:12,961
It's Europe's longest river, with a basin roughly 3.6 times the size of Japan.

30
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:20,842
About 60 million people live in this basin—that's 40% of Russia's population.

31
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:26,549
Most major Russian cities rely on the blessings of this river.

32
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:30,614
It's especially vital for Moscow's drinking water.

33
00:02:30,714 --> 00:02:34,530
90% of Moscow's water comes from the Volga.

34
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:41,885
The basin also supports over 25% of Russia's total agricultural production.

35
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:46,610
Russians call it "Volga-Matushka," or "Mother Volga."

36
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:52,365
So, what happened to this Mother River?

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,512
The cause lies in the massive development projects of the Soviet era.

38
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:03,228
In the early 1900s, the USSR industrialized rapidly.

39
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:07,528
They needed electricity and waterways to transport goods.

40
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:13,484
So, the Soviets decided to artificially "remodel" the Volga River.

41
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,734
The results were indeed remarkable.

42
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:22,254
Eight massive dams were built, generating huge amounts of power.

43
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:30,625
A network of canals connected the Baltic, Black, White, Azov, and Caspian seas.

44
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:35,673
Moscow became known as the "Port of the Five Seas."

45
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:40,610
But this rapid development came at a terrible price.

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,744
Many forced laborers were used to build these dams and canals.

47
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:54,774
Thousands are believed to have died building the Moscow Canal, finished in 1937.

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,912
Furthermore, massive reservoirs were created behind the dams.

49
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,360
The largest is about seven times the size of Lake Biwa.

50
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:11,001
Many villages were submerged to make way for these giant lakes.

51
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,232
Residents were forcibly relocated, and their displacement left homes at the bottom of the lake.

52
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:24,574
Church steeples still poke through the surface, reminding us of what was lost.

53
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:28,486
Even worse is the change in the river's flow.

54
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:32,162
Dams have greatly reduced the Volga's water flow.

55
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:37,230
Some reports say it's down to just one-tenth of its original flow.

56
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,474
When a river slows down, what happens?

57
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:44,606
Pollutants don't wash away; they just settle in place.

58
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:49,506
Industrial waste, fertilizers, and pesticides from farms...

59
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:55,265
These built up at the bottom of reservoirs as meters of toxic sludge.

60
00:04:56,433 --> 00:05:00,369
The Soviet Union prioritized immediate results.

61
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:03,445
Power, shipping, irrigation.

62
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:06,393
There were huge short-term benefits.

63
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:12,681
But the Volga is now suffering the cost of those short-term gains.

64
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:17,682
The Volga is now one of the most polluted rivers in Russia.

65
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:23,981
40% of all Russian wastewater is concentrated in this one river.

66
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:27,441
Soviet-era environmental laws existed.

67
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:32,931
But for factories, it was cheaper to pay the fines than to clean their waste.

68
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,364
This practice didn't change after the Soviet collapse.

69
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:44,656
Even now, only 10% of wastewater treatment meets regulatory standards.

70
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:50,870
It's been 30 years since the USSR fell, and 90 since the first dams.

71
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:55,609
Yet there's been no real improvement in water quality.

72
00:05:56,766 --> 00:06:02,262
The government launched a massive 205 billion ruble cleanup project,

73
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:07,810
investing about 400 billion yen over six years to save the Volga.

74
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:16,004
However, the Accounts Chamber has noted that there's almost no visible progress.

75
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:22,045
The reason: "time bombs" buried in the Soviet era are everywhere.

76
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:27,769
The "White Sea" I mentioned earlier is a perfect example.

77
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:32,501
This 28-hectare white structure in Volgograd...

78
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:39,675
...houses between 1.5 and 3.5 million tons of toxic waste.

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,840
During the Cold War's arms race with the United States,

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,376
the USSR built chemical weapons and dumped the waste into this pool.

81
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:56,958
Toxins thousands of times above safety levels still lie dormant there.

82
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:03,786
In the 70s, after dumping massive amounts of lime for neutralization,

83
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:07,666
the pond turned white, earning the name "White Sea."

84
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:11,870
Under the Soviets, this factory was a military secret.

85
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:16,434
Pointing out pollution was considered an act of treason.

86
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,072
Criticism simply wasn't allowed.

87
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:25,613
When the USSR collapsed, no one wanted to take responsibility.

88
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:29,337
In a crisis, there was no budget for the environment.

89
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:32,245
The treatment costs are astronomical.

90
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,812
So, the problem just kept getting pushed aside.

91
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,564
It's now covered by a white dome as a temporary containment measure,

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,592
but snowmelt or heavy rain could leak toxins into the Volga at any time.

93
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:54,594
There are many of these toxic bombs hidden along the Volga basin.

94
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:59,278
In the era of developmental dictatorship, only results mattered.

95
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,507
Costs were hidden, criticism silenced, and duty made vague.

96
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,901
The result is this "White Sea."

97
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:16,822
Sadly, the day we see Mother Volga restored to its true beauty may still be far off.

98
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:24,809
Even so, I hope we can move forward one step at a time.

99
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,684
The Volga supports 60 million lives as Russia's Mother River.

100
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:35,379
But through Soviet obsession with short-term growth,

101
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,447
the price was hidden, leaving a dark legacy that persists today.

102
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:45,179
Even 90 years later, the Mother River is still in pain.

103
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:49,611
How do we balance development and the environment?

104
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,956
I made this video because I believe this is a vital question for every country and every era.

105
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,905
See you in the next video. Have a good day!
